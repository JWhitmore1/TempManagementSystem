# TempManagementSystem
Temperature management system webapp, pulling data from a datalogger and an API, with a customisable threshold, and database

### Stimulus:

Manufacturing companies need to carefully monitor the temperature of their internal workspaces to make sure that their workers are not experiencing heat stress. WorkSafe Queensland recommends that companies undergo heat stress assessments that calculate a risk score based on apparent temperature and job requirements. To assist with this calculation, you are required to build a prototype IoT system that:

  • measures the internal temperature and humidity

  • automatically analyses this data to calculate the apparent temperature


The IoT system must have a web interface that allows managers to: 

  • view the current outside and inside apparent temperatures

  • update the safe temperature threshold, depending on job requirements As the web interface is being developed for the G.James Group, it must:

  • be clear and consistent with their current website (https://gjames.com/)

  • comply with accessibility guidelines (see below)

  • include the G.James logo 
  • Would like to be able to view the current temperature on a large screen in the factory
